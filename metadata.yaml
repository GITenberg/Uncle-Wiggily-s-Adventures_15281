description: The Uncle Wiggily series of children's stories began to appear in newspapers
  in the early decades of the twentieth century. Soon afterwards, the tales began
  to be collected in book form. The stories in Uncle Wiggily's Adventures follow the
  wise old rabbit Uncle Wiggily as he navigates a world populated by woodland creatures
  of both the nice and not-so-nice varieties. This collection is sure to enchant and
  delight readers young and old.
